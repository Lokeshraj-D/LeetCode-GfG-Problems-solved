# [FINDING MINIMUM IN ROTATED SORTED ARRAY](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

### Difficulty: ***Medium***

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```
```
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```
Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
