# [REVERSE NODES IN K GROUPS](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/)

### Difficulty: ***Hard***

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
